					<h3>September 2009 - October 2010</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">Developer at Superbreak Mini Holidays</p>
					<p>The main responsibility of this role is to maintain the company's customer facing website. As well as general customers, the company provides a SOAP web service API to allow partners to search and book products. Shortly after joining, I began working on integrating the API with the site framework as well as providing support for the API customers. Another project I've worked on was to create a testing framework that allowed the non-development teams to create web usability tests and schedule blocks of testing for each new release. This used <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" title="Selenium web application testing system">Selenium</a> to allow the site to be tested across various browsers and operating systems.</p>
