Wow!

Still getting lots of emails about the [Photo Rotator app][1] so I have a few features that I'd like to implement for the next update, which won't be for a few weeks since I'm currently finishing off my university degree and need to focus on that. Keep sending your feature requests/comments/questions to ipod@bolsterweb.com and, if I can, I'll stick them on the to-do list.

So just a thanks to all the kind emails I've been sent already :) And a whopping great big thanks to the massive support for Photo Rotator. **1,865** of you downloaded it yesterday!

I will keep you all up to date. Who knows? It might even make it to 5,000 downloads in it's first weekend!

Thanks again,
Jonathon
