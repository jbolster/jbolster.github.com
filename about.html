I'm a 24 year old web developer, currently living in Oxford but originally from Ireland. I like programming in C# .NET with ASP .NET MVC - not to say I don't program in other things (and playing with electronics). When I'm online and not doing other things, I tend to be active on Stack Overflow. When I'm offline, I'm usually not active (something I need to sort!).

One day, I hope to have a tortoise as a pet.
