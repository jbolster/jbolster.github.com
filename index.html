					<h4>Computer Systems and Software Engineering - MEng</h4>
					<a href="http://www.york.ac.uk" title="The University of York" class="org summary">The University of York, York</a></header>
					<p>Studying at York helped develop my understanding of Computer Science, with emphasis placed on system design principles and modules in all parts of the system life cycle â€” including databases, mathematics in computer science, programming principles and system design within the context of other systems. I particularly enjoyed the real time and embedded systems modules, although I also found the non-standard computation modules interesting.</p>

					<h4>Developer, GTI Recruiting Solutions</h4>
					<p>My team works on developing a multi-tenant platform to allow the existing clients (who currently have separate systems forked from a single base) to work with our multi-entry / multi-database application. Much of the work is to redesign components of the legacy system to work with our new environment while deciding base functionality versus bespoke. A particular part of the system that I took charge of was the implementation of SOLR as our search index - including how the system uses faceting and geocoded searching. Another 'soft skills' element of my role is that I have changed the management of releases to allow for more frequent cycles - combined with usage of a CI server/Selenium test suite to increase confidence in each build.</p>

					<p>This web development role at the Bodleian Libraries focused mainly on providing support for the MySource Matrix CMS system that was in place. As well as this, management of the Google Analytics account was also required - including creation of filters for different groups within the libraries. One project I was asked to complete was the Book Moves Visualisation page. This was a page done mostly in JavaScript and jQuery, with CSS to create a directional graph.</p>
