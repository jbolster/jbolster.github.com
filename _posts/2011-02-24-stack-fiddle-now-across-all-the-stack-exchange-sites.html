Today was Stack Fiddle's first day in the wild and it seems to have been received incredibly well. Thanks to everyone who sent me suggestions and comments about it.

<strong>So now it's up to version <del>1.0.4.</del> 1.0.5 Yeay!</strong> (I messed up the manifest)

Today has been a busy day:
<ul>
	<li>I posted it on <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/2114/stack-fiddle-easily-create-a-jsfiddle-from-stack-overflow">StackApps</a></li>
	<li>Created the <a href="https://github.com/jbolster/Stack-Fiddle">github project</a></li>
	<li>Added two features that were requested:
             <ul><li>Enable/Disable the context menu (it now only appears on StackExchange sites)</li>
	           <li>Enable Stack Fiddle on all the Stack Exchange sites</li>
                 </ul>
        </li>
	<li>Only display on pages with certain (customisable) tags</li>
	<li>Tidied up the code to make it a bit</li>
</ul>

So yeah, if you have any suggestions for Stack Fiddle - just get in touch! I'm interested in hearing everything - comments, suggestions, bug reports or anything that you think would just be fun to know.
