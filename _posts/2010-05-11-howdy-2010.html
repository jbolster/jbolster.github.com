It's been nearly a year since I posted anything and, since then, I've grown sick of my current Word Press theme so I've installed this nice little theme for the mean time. I might design my own (a nice one) but for the moment this one will do.

Since last time:

* I graduated
* I got a job here in York
* I'm still here

So yup - that's my exciting life. I've been playing with .NET 3.5 (and poking my nose into .NET 4 recently) so I'll probably have a thing or two to say about that.
