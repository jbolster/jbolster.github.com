Hurrah! I've been reading a bit about HTML5 and creating a wordpress template, so here's a new design.

I've moved from [Blogger][1] to using WordPress on my own server. Gives me a little bit more flexibility, but I think it might sacrifice a little on the Google search. Ahh well. One annoying thing in the import/export is that it imported the tags as categories. I'll sort that out - I was probably just using it wrong.

Hopefully the design works alright - though it might be broken in one or two parts. If anything seems horribly broken, then please let me know. I also plan on playing with a CSS style to make it work nicely on the iPhone too.

Update: In WordPress, there's a Categories to Tags tool. Woo!
