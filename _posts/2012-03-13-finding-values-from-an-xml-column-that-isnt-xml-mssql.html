I had a little bit of an issue at work when I had to create a query that returned values that were stored in an XML column. Normally you can use the [XML value method][1] to get these. My problem was that the column I wanted had XML stored in it but wasn't actually defined as an XML type.

This requires a conversion into XML. For anyone looking at the same problem, this is what I did

```sql
    SELECT 
        tbl.ColumnName
        ref.value('FirstName[1]', 'nvarchar(100)') as [FirstName],
        ref.value('LastName[1]', 'nvarchar(100)') as [LastName],
    FROM myTable tbl 
    CROSS APPLY (SELECT CONVERT(xml, tbl.MyNonXmlCol)) as T(X)
    CROSS APPLY T.X.nodes('//AuthorDetails[1]') R(ref)
```
