Alright, I think I'm all sorted. I've my bag packed and all my bits and pieces printed out. All I have to do now is get to sleep for my 6.30am start in the morning. And, of course, make sure I don't forget my passport!

I don't usually write random bits but felt I should just because I can. Hopefully there'll be enough fon spots around for the free wifi :-)
