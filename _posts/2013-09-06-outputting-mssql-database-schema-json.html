Why would I want to do this at all? Surely this is madness, I hear you say!

I wanted to be evil for a little bit (side note: don't be evil) and I was playing with [Troy Hunt's][1] [invitation to hack his site][2]. Well, not his personal site but one he set up for a course he's running.

I noticed that there was a SQL injection attack on one of the pages and wanted to see just how much information about the database I could get from that.

Then I created this (well, it was slightly modified to hack Troy's site):

```sql
select '{database_name:"' + db_name() +'", tables: [' +
STUFF((
	SELECT ',{'+ti.tableInfo +'}'
	FROM
	(
		select 'table_name: "'+ t.name + '", columns: [' +
		STUFF(
							(
								SELECT  ',{column_name: "' + CAST(c.column_name AS VARCHAR) 
								+ '", type: "' + cast(c.data_type as varchar) 
								+ '", char_max_length: "' + cast(c.CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH as varchar)
								+ '", char_octet_length: "' + cast(c.CHARACTER_OCTET_LENGTH as varchar) 
								+'", nullable: '+ CASE c.is_nullable WHEN 'YES' THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END + '}'
								FROM information_schema.columns c
								where c.table_name = t.name
								FOR XML PATH('')
							)
						,   1
						,   1
						,   ''
					) + ']' as [tableInfo]
		FROM sys.Tables t
	) as ti
	FOR XML PATH('')
), 1, 1 ,'') + ']}'
```

What the above piece of code does is create a JSON version of your database schema. It uses some hackery of using [STUFF][3] a couple of times to pull information about the columns and the tables (well, I say hackery because it looked hideous but works).

A tiny bit of HTML, JS, and Knockout and I have a lovely little jsbin to describe the schema: [http://jsbin.com/uZibesO/1][5] 

Of course, this was all a bit of learning for me and I don't actually intend to hack a website so just in case people didn't see the note above: DON'T BE EVIL.

I also recommend [Troy's course on PluralSight][4] (which goes with his 'Hack yourself first' site).
