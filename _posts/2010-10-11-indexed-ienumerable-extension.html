The original intention for this was to clean up some code which was calling a `Select` to get an Index value so that basic zebra striping of rows could be done. It return an `IndexedType` generic class of type `T` which has properties for the original object and the index value of it.

```csharp
public static IEnumerable<IndexedType<T>> Index<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source)
{
	return source.Select((x, i) => new IndexedType<T>() { Item = x, Index = i });
}
```

And the class returned:

```csharp
public class IndexedType<T>
{
	public T Item { get; set; }
	public int Index { get; set; }
}
```

This could be extended to include values like if the index value is even, N-Indexed values, etc but I leave that up to the imagination of the programmer.
