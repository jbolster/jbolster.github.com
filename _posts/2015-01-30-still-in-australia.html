Apparently plans change quite a bit!

I am still in Australia and plan to stick around for a lot longer - currently waiting my Permanent Residence! So, my short holiday in Australia has turned into something much bigger.

This blog has definitely been a bit quiet over the last year but I have a load of gists with snippets of code I've done and want to write about.

Stay tuned.
