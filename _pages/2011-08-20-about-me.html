I'm a 24 year old web developer, currently living in Oxford but originally from <a title="Ireland as a teddy" href="http://www.bolsterweb.com/2009/01/ireland-as-a-teddy/">Ireland</a>. I like programming in C# .NET with ASP .NET MVC - not to say I don't program in other things (and playing with electronics). When I'm online and not doing other things, I tend to be active on <a title="Stack Overflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. When I'm offline, I'm usually not active (something I need to sort!).

One day, I hope to have a tortoise as a pet.
