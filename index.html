						<p>Studying at York helped develop my understanding of Computer Science, with emphasis placed on system design principles and modules in all parts of the system life cycle &mdash; including databases, mathematics in computer science, programming principles and system design within the context of other systems. I particularly enjoyed the real time and embedded systems modules, although I also found the non-standard computation modules interesting.</p>
						<p>The modules I chose during my Masters focused mostly on real time and embedded systems; my final project investigated the use of <a href="http://marte.unican.es" title="MaRTE OS">MaRTE OS</a> and <a href="http://jrate.sourceforge.net" title="jRate (a Real-Time Java ahead-of-time compiler)">jRate</a> with a view to teaching the Real Time Systems course using RTSJ, instead of Ada. This involved extending the current compiler and most development work was done in Assembly, C and Java.</p>

						<p>This web development role at the Bodleian Libraries focused mainly on providing support for the MySource Matrix CMS system that was in place. As well as this, management of the Google Analytics account was also required - including creation of filters for different groups within the libraries. One project I was asked to complete was the Book Moves Visualisation page. This was a page done mostly in JavaScript and jQuery, with CSS to create a directional graph.</p>

						<p>The main responsibility of this role is to maintain the company's customer facing website. As well as general customers, the company provides a SOAP web service API to allow partners to search and book products. Shortly after joining, I began working on integrating the API with the site framework as well as providing support for the API customers. Another project I've worked on was to create a testing framework that allowed the non-development teams to create web usability tests and schedule blocks of testing for each new release. This used <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" title="Selenium web application testing system">Selenium</a> to allow the site to be tested across various browsers and operating systems.</p>

						<p>Employed under university sponsorship, I worked as part of the research and development team whilst working closely with other R&amp;D teams in offices across the world. Together, we developed and maintained business process management software produced in-house. During my time, I had been appointed to develop a working prototype of a new interface to the existing software, which has since been developed further by the company to replace the older system. This included researching potential tools and ultimately creating a solid class framework which other developers in the company could use easily without having to do the same research as I had to.</p>
