I've been fairly quiet over the last few months with no blog posts and very little in the way of Twitter messages.

I'm in Australia! After resigning from my previous role, I picked up my passport and decided to venture half way across the world for a bit of travelling. So far I've been away from the UK for 4 months and in that time I've done a lot of amazing things - hand-feeding dolphins and diving in the Great Barrier Reef being among some of my favourites.

For the meantime, I've decided to try and gain some employment so that my passport pages can get a few more stamps before I return home! If you happen to know of any development work in the sunny country, please let me know. Otherwise, keep an eye on [my github page][1] to see what I'm up to.
