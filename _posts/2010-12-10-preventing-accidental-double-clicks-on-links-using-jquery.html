I recently answered [this question on StackOverflow][1] asking how to prevent someone from clicking a link multiple times.

This is the solution I came up with:

    $("a").click(function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();

        if (!$(this).data('isClicked')) {
            var link = $(this);

            // Your code on successful click

            // Set the isClicked value and set a timer to reset in 3s
            link.data('isClicked', true);
            setTimeout(function() {
            link.removeData('isClicked')
            }, 3000);
        } else {
            // Anything you want to say 'Bad user!'
        }
    });

You can use [jQuery's data storage][2] methods to assign arbitrary bits of data to specific DOM elements. In this case, when the user clicks a link I assign a property to the element as well as setting a timer to remove it 3 seconds later. This lets me know if the specific element has already been clicked by just calling the `data` method.

It's not a bullet proof solution since it's incredibly easy to get around if you're determined enough. However, it is a simple example of how you can use those methods.
