Tonight, I was bored. Seriously, it was either this or watching the Eurovision song contest. Sadly, with BBC iPlayer, I was able to do both.

I've decided that when I have kids, they're going to know how to use computers and learn how to program (I can wish).

So, I've rewritten the story of Little Red Riding Hood. This time it's in C#. I have no idea why I decided I would do this - by the time I'd realised, it was too late

So if you want to tell your kids a bedtime story whilst edging them into becoming programmers, read on.

	};

	// Once upon a time, there was one little girl who was loved by everyone. Her
	// grandmother especially loved her and gave her a Red Riding Hood, which suited
	// her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was called 'Little
	// Red Riding Hood'
	var littleRedRidingHood = population.Where(x =>
									x.Sex == Sex.Female &&

This actually compiles and runs to a happy ending (with the source of the other classes, of course). If you're going to read it as a bed time story to your children, it may as well compile.
